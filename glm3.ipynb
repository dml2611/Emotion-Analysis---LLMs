The author also mentions that life causes cancer and can't avoid all the things that can give them cancer. The author also mentions that they feel like they are grounding themselves and finding a sense of fixing and placement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe English text mentions the following aspects related to cancer:\n\n1. The individual has been diagnosed with stage IV cancer since 2015.\n2. The diagnosis was first made in 2007, and at that time, there was no such thing as remission for a late stage melanoma patient.\n3. The individual is currently undergoing targeted therapy as recommended by their oncologist, and they suspect that some cancer cells may still be present.\n4. The news of the diagnosis was considered amazing by the individual, despite the ongoing treatment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe text mentions that the person has been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer and is losing weight rapidly, with a prediction that they may not survive for several weeks or months. The person also mentions their difficult childhood with an alcoholic and drug-addictive mother and a father who did not care for them. They have had a string of abusive and borderline personality disorder (BPD) relationships, and have never been married or had children. They feel angry and frustrated with their life and the circumstances that have affected them. The person also mentions that their father tries to talk about \"god's plan,\" but they do not believe in a higher power and are angry at their family and the universe for their difficult life.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe English text mentions that the person's father has been diagnosed with melanoma, stage IV. The original prognosis was given as \"sept 22,\" but the immunotherapy he has been receiving has been effective in keeping the cancer at bay and recent scans and blood results have shown no change. The person is happy for their father and is wishing the best of luck to others who have recently received cancer related news. They mention that they are technically not a caregiver, but apologize if they have offended anyone.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe text mentions that the father has been diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) with a PD-L1 expression greater than 90%. He has undergone radiotherapy for bone mets, but the main therapy is keytruda immunotherapy. The text states that the father had his first checkup since starting the therapy and that the oncologist's appointment is on Friday. The radiologist reported that the lesions in the lung had gone back by 40-50% compared to the last scan, which was a significant improvement. The text also mentions that the radiologist said that the biggest and most worrying of the lesions all shrunk the most, which is a positive development.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe English text describes the treatment of a person's wife for stage IV metastatic breast cancer. She received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy for 13 months. The cancer eventually ended on a Tuesday morning, and she was just 36 years old. The speaker will miss her forever but will always cherish the 11 and a half years they spent together.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe text describes the situation of a person whose mother has been diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, with high grade serous. The mother has had three surgeries, 20 rounds of chemotherapy, and is currently on hospice care. The person is 71 years old and was recently hospitalized for colitis. The doctors have told the person that there is nothing more to be done. The person is facing the reality of their mother's death and is struggling to accept it. They express anger and frustration at the situation, but also have a sense of determination to find a way to move past the anger and accept the reality of their mother's passing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe English text describes the author's mother's diagnosis with stage IV lung cancer in August 2020, which was accompanied by a large pneumothorax and empyema that required a tube in her right lung to drain. The author believes they had lost their mother at the time. The mother's condition improved in September, and she was considered a candidate for Tagrisso, a drug for EGFR-positive patients. In December, the mother started coughing up blood and became extremely tired. Scans showed that her tumor had slowed down, but during an ER visit for a drop in hemoglobin, it was discovered that the tumor was causing a major bleed. The mother finished 10 rounds of radiation, but her hemoglobin continued to drop, and a CT scan revealed that she had a separate kidney cancer, as well as lung cancer that had eroded past her diaphragm and was pushing on her liver, causing internal bleeding. The mother had a minor procedure done to embolize or clog up the bleeding, which caused her oxygen levels to drop drastically. She is currently in the ICU, and the author has made a decision not to put her on a ventilator. The author has anticipatory grief for the loss of their mother and is grateful for the time they had together. The author calls their mother several times a week and is described as a \"momma's boy.\" The author's mother passed away with no hospice care. The author plans to live on with their mother's morals and values.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe text mentions that the speaker has stage IV ulms, which is a type of cancer, and is starting to experience fatigue and pain. The speaker let their employer know they were diagnosed earlier in the year and decided to go on disability. The speaker mentions that they have 12 months, if they're lucky, and will fight to be lucky. They mention that they took a long time to get through college, dropped out a few times, but finally found a career that fit them well. The speaker was very good at their job and prided themselves on being a \"superstar.\" They mention that they did a lot for their employers, got them on solid systems and processes, created policies, wikis, how-to videos, and step by step diagrams for everything they were or had been doing. They feel like a big part of themselves has been sliced clean off their body and their brain can't process that they are effectively retired. They mention that their family and friends don't understand how hard it is for them, and that cancer took pieces of them but not the thing they loved the most, their career.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe text mentions that the speaker was diagnosed with stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma in December and has completed 5 rounds of chemotherapy. The speaker received a call from their oncologist yesterday and was told that they needed to see the speaker as soon as possible. The speaker went to the hospital and was called into their oncologist's office, where the oncologist told the speaker that the cancer has not gone and has not responded to the chemo as hoped, meaning the speaker will be placed on a stronger dosage of chemo for 7 more rounds and will also need radiation 2-3 times a week. The speaker is an 18-year-old college student who is completing their freshman year and will be doing online courses offered by the university they attended last year, instead of moving back into their dorm. The speaker is also considering transferring to a school closer to where they are living but is unsure if they want to leave their dream school.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"clinical_entities = []\nfor txt in text:\n    response, history = model.chat(tokenizer,  f\"Extract the clinical named entities from the English text:'{txt}'\", history=[])\n    print(response)\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    clinical_entities.append(response)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-15T21:45:19.990430Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-15T21:45:19.991056Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-15T21:51:02.120630Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-15T21:45:19.991024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-15T21:51:02.119658Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Clinical named entities:\n\n* Stage IV gallbladder cancer\n* Surgery\n* Chemo (chemotherapy)\n* Cat scan\n* Radiation treatment\n* Grateful\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClinical named entities extracted from the text:\n\n* Lung cancer\n* Stage IV\n* primary tumors\n* radiation\n* chemotherapy\n* stents\n* pleural effusion\n* pericardial effusion\n* pluerx drains\n* best friend\n* wife\n* favorite food taster\n* mother\n* household\n* honest\n* kind\n* caregiver\n* rock\n* primary caregiver\n* diagnosis\n* treatment\n* rock\n* support\n* sleep\n* 24/7\n* primary\n* family\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClinical named entities extracted from the English text:\n\n1.

They then underwent 10 weeks of chemotherapy and a CT scan last Friday. Despite the cancer, they are feeling grateful for the news and will continue to undergo radiation treatment for the next 5 weeks. They use an expletive to express their frustration with cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn November 17, 2021, the author's wife lost her battle with stage IV lung cancer, which she was diagnosed with on January 5, 2021. Despite the numerous treatments and complications, the author's wife smiled and remained optimistic throughout their journey. She was the author's best friend, wife, favorite food taster, and the mother to their household. The author was also the primary caregiver and rock for her, spending every day by her side. Now, the author is left to navigate life without her and is struggling to come to terms with the loss.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage IV cervical cancer in September, but a recent CT scan shows no cancer. The author will receive a pet scan in three weeks to confirm, but today is their final chemo infusion. If the pet scan is clear, the author will receive Avastin infusions every three weeks for a total of 12 infusions to prevent new cancer appearances. The author is overjoyed and grateful for the support they have received from others in a subreddit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author is a 16-year-old teenager who was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. After two rounds of chemotherapy, another pet scan showed promising progress, with most of the tumors reduced by half. The author is excited about the news but still has two more rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy to go.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in May 2019, and he underwent extensive chemo, liver surgery, and another round of chemo on Christmas Eve. The author and their family are now five months cancer-free, and they are hoping for a permanent cure. The author thanks the community for their support and encourages others on the same journey.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author of the post reflects on their experience with melanoma, a type of skin cancer. They describe how they were initially diagnosed and how they felt after posting a \"cry for help\" on a subreddit. They received dismissive responses from others, despite the seriousness of melanoma. The author later found out that their cancer was stage 2c melanoma, which was considered an awkward place to be treatment-wise at the time. They mention that there have been advances in treatment options for melanoma in the past decade, including immunotherapy, but that it is only available for stage 3 and 4 melanoma. The author also mentions that there is no \"good\" cancer and that going through harsh treatment does not necessarily mean a patient has a \"better\" disease. They express their frustration with the lack of support they received from friends and others and how it affected them.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer, and he moved back home to help care for him and his mother. He spent several weeks and eventually months at the hospital getting infusions and drainings. Despite the challenges, he tried to keep a positive attitude and do the things they always enjoyed, such as jamming, joking, and eating waffles. The author also got a new job that changed his career path and tripled his salary. He met a girl and they have been together for over a year. The author reflects on the lessons he learned from his father's experience and how it has made him a better person. He thanks everyone for their support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author, who is 29 and was diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer in October 2019, is currently undergoing a type of immunotherapy. They met with their doctor and were told that if the treatment doesn't work, they likely have less than six months to live. This has caused the author to feel sad, scared, and angry, and they have cried more than they have their entire life combined. They are unsure whether to continue with their plans to get married or cancel them, as it seems pointless if the author doesn't know if they will live long enough for the wedding to happen. They are also concerned about the process of dying and whether they will be alone in a hospital bed. The author doesn't want to come across as selfish, but they feel it's not fair to keep going through this. They are seeking advice on how to cope with this difficult situation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with testicular cancer 24 days ago and had bloodwork, x-rays, and imaging to determine if it had spread. Two days after Christmas, the author underwent an orchiectomy. This Thursday, the author met with the surgeon/urologist and was declared cancer-free. The author is a survivor and has compassion and respect for those who had a longer and more difficult journey. The author thanks r/cancer for their support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has received some good news about their cancer, as they were told that all of their stage IV melanoma is gone, after only 4 infusions of yervoy/opdivo and 2 infusions of opdivo alone. The author feels like they have been given a second chance to make their life better and that the hardships they went through have made them stronger. The author is optimistic that if the cancer comes back, they will be able to fight it again. The author encourages others who are still fighting cancer to stay strong and keep going.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is preparing for scan results from their stage IV melanoma, and will be traveling to the oncologist for the results. They will be enjoying delicious food from Del Taco and Xanex before and after the scans. They will then have CT and MRI scans, but are looking forward to the most delicious BBQ, mac and cheese, and banana pudding for dinner from a new restaurant called What-A-Burger. The speaker is losing weight and is looking forward to dining like kings. They hope that their cancer isn't back.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author experienced sudden severe abdominal pain and went to the ER. The ultrasound did not show any stones, but an X-ray revealed a mass in the lower left lung. Further tests, including a biopsy, pet scan, and CT scans, were negative. However, the pulmonologist later found neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors with metaplastic bone formation. The author has a large mass in the lower left lung and other growths in the airway that has spread to the lymph nodes. The doctor's are holding a meeting to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The author is trying to stay positive and enjoy the holiday season with their family. They are focusing on the love and support of their family and looking forward to the new year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is excited to take a bath after months due to cancer treatment, but is also emotional because of the experience.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author is a 28-year old survivor of kidney cancer. They share their story to raise awareness and encourage people to listen to their bodies. In October 2016, the author went to the ER with stomach pain and was told by an ER doctor that they had a \"spot\" on their kidney, but it was nothing to worry about. The author wanted more answers and sought out a urologist, but the second doctor didn't ask any questions and assumed it was benign. The third doctor, who was a colleague of the first doctor, agreed with the first doctor's assessment, but the author decided to trust the third doctor. The author had the surgery and was diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, stage 1, grade 2. They lost part of a kidney but are otherwise okay. The author believes in science, but also believes in the self and the importance of listening to one's body.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe narrative describes a person who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and tumors in their brain in 2011. The hospital gave them a couple of months to live, but they decided to seek a second opinion at City of Hope Hospital. The doctors there were surprised at the radiation and chemo intensity and told the person that they would have made them a vegetable if they had followed through with the treatment. The person had surgery to remove tumors from their brain and some radiation, and low-dose chemo and radiation for the lung tumors. They went into remission for 3 years, but had another mass on their lung in 2014, which required more radiation and chemo. Recently, a scan showed masses on their brain that resembled cauliflower, and a biopsy was done to find out what it was, but it went away a month later. The person's doctor says it's a miracle that they're still alive,虽然他们的精神和体力可能没有以前那么好了，但他们还是坚强地生活着。\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has stage III vulvar cancer with bilateral lymph node involvement. After surgery, chemo, and radiation, the cancer came back clear in the pet/CT scan. Despite the progress, there is still a chance it could come back, but for now, the speaker has won.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage 3c colorectal cancer in February 2018 and beat it after 6 months of chemo and radiation. However, it came back in his liver in May 2019, and he had to undergo another 6 months of chemo and an outstanding surgery before being cancer-free in November 2019. The author is currently celebrating a recent decrease in his cancer marker to an all-time low of 0.5, but acknowledges that they are not out of the woods yet. The author thanks the Reddit community for their support and also plugs the doctors who helped them on their journey, Dr. Remtulla and Dr. Geller.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's mother passed away after a battle with stage IV renal cancer. The author and their family were with her all night and experienced her pain and the death rattle. The author feels empty and lost and is sorry for the pain their mother endured. They express their frustration and anger towards cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, but after multiple treatments including liver resections, radiation, chemo, and a rectal resection, they are now cancer-free. They credit their family and friends for their support during the difficult time. The author expresses hope that a cure for the disease will be found soon and that those who are diagnosed can receive the same uplifting news they did. They also express concern for those close to them who may have to undergo similar treatments in the future.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic urethelial cancer, which is 90% of bladder cancers and the sixth most common cancer in the US. The author entered a trial using enfortumab vedotin combined with cisplatin, and all signs of cancer were gone by the second scan. However, the author is still receiving treatment, and they will reevaluate in March. The oncologist attributes the author's success to good health and a great support system, and while the prognosis is still considered incurable, the author is not losing hope. The author encourages others not to lose hope or pay attention to statistics.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has stage IV malignant melanoma and recently had a pet scan to check the progress of the tumor and lesions after 3 infusions of opdivo and 2 infusions with opdivo and yervoy. The scan showed that the tumor and lesions are either gone or very close to gone. The author will continue to receive monthly infusions of zometa to prevent bone weakness. The oncologists believe there will be no evidence of disease at the next pet scan in 3 months, and if so, the appointments will be changed to a six-month schedule. The author is feeling relieved and grateful for the treatment received at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has been receiving treatment for cancer for 14 months, but the chemo options are no longer working and the cancer is spreading rapidly. They have been hospitalized twice for neutropenia, and their organs are not doing well. The oncologist and palliative doctor are supporting no further treatment, and the author is being encouraged to do their last wishes and get their affairs in order. They are told they have months left. The author's outlook is positive, but they are curious about what will happen to them and their family. They are worried about their family's emotional well-being when their pain ends. The author has an incredible team of doctors at a progressive cancer treatment center.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has been dealing with the discovery of a large teratoma in their ovaries, which was initially thought to be benign. The author had laparoscopic surgery to remove the teratoma, but the pathology results came back as malignant, with the type of cancer being in the 1%. The author is stage 1, and they will have to undergo surgery again to remove the right ovary. The author is scared that the cancer will escalate and is feeling overwhelmed by the bad news. They have had to cancel their graduation, prom, and trip to Italy due to quarantine, and they don't know if they will be able to attend NYU this year. The author is reaching out for support and hoping for some good news.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage 1a endometrial adenocarcinoma, which is better than it could have been, and they are relieved and grateful. They express their frustration with the idea that some people believe they are lucky to have cancer, and they use an expletive to express their feelings about cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker expresses empathy to those affected by cancer, but also shares their personal experience of having stage IV cancer and being in active treatment. They acknowledge that the long-term prognosis is grim, but for now, everything is okay. The speaker is taking a break from work, feeling well, and looking forward to spending time with their family. The speaker suggests that cancer can be a source of deep sadness, but that life can still be good.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's wife has been diagnosed with stage 1 non-metastasized cervical cancer. After a second biopsy and pet scan, the oncologist confirmed that the cancer is curable with 5 weeks of chemo and radiation, followed by 2 weeks of immunal therapy, resulting in a 90% cure rate. Despite the initial stress and fear, the author is now feeling positive and hopeful for a happy lifetime with his wife. He thanks everyone for their love and support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn August 2017, the speaker's father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. He deteriorated rapidly and there were times when the speaker didn't think he would survive until the new year. Two years later, the speaker's father celebrated his 75th birthday and is now happy, healthy, and full of life. The doctors believe he may have beaten the stage IV lung cancer, and there has been no evidence of growth on any of his scans in over a year. They plan to give him two more infusions and then take him off treatment and monitor for growth. The speaker is grateful to the doctors and physicians of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and everyone on this subreddit who provided comfort and advice in the early days. They believe that no matter how bad the diagnosis, there is always hope, and it isn't false hope. The speaker prays for everyone here who is fighting their own battle against cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the stomach in November 2019, with the prognosis being 6-10 months. He began treatment with infusions but had to stop due to low white cell counts. He then switched to an oral regimen for 7 months before another round of difficulties started, including jaundice and tests for hepatitis. In March 2021, he was admitted to the hospital with stomach pain and was later diagnosed with a blockage in the liver. The doctors decided not to do a biliary stint and instead will perform a drain, which will make him more comfortable. The author's father is at month 16 of his 10-month maximum prognosis and is surrounded by family and friends. He has few regrets in life and will go on his own terms.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA person has stage IV Ewing's sarcoma and has tried chemotherapy, radiation, and medication but it did not work. They just returned from the Hope4Cure cancer treatment center in Mexico but seem to be in more pain. The person wants to try CBD (cannabidiol) and other alternative drugs but is unable to afford it. They have started a chip-in and ask for donations, with the promise of sending a comic from their collection and keeping donors updated on the person's condition. The person's best friend passed away last night and the community is sending thoughts, prayers, and meditations. The person also mentions the possibility of setting up a charity for the person.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe person is writing about their experience with Ewing sarcoma, a type of cancer that affects children. They describe their journey of treatment, including high-dose chemotherapy, radiation, and a stem transplant. Despite finishing treatment and having a scan that showed no signs of cancer, the person started experiencing back pain again three weeks after treatment. They had a scan and found that the cancer had come back and was pressing on nerves, causing back pain. They have since undergone treatment again, including chemo pills, radiation, and surgery, but they feel like the cancer is not being cured and they will not be able to achieve their desired future. They express frustration and sadness at the impact of the cancer on their life and their future plans.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author started a new job in June for a small company, and everyone seemed team-oriented and friendly. However, the author found out they had breast cancer, which required frequent time off for surgery, recovery, and treatments. The author explained the situation to HR, and they promised to keep the position open for when the author was recovered. However, two days later, the author received an email saying the company had decided to go in a different direction and that the author was done. The author was upset and felt that their recovery and cancer treatment were not respected. The author had to fight to get their equipment back and a receipt of return, and they felt that the company's priority was on their Avaya phone and dinky monitor, rather than on the author's well-being.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage 1b liposarcoma in their right bicep in March 2018, and the tumor was removed on March 15, 2018. yesterday, the Northwestern team reviewed the pathology and CT, and the final treatment plan was no additional surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.

The author and their aunt felt instant relief and spent the rest of the day walking and shopping before having dinner.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author of the post was initially treated for stage 1 ovarian cancer and experienced burnout, but is now pleased to announce that they have completed their three cycles of chemotherapy and are cancer-free. However, the post notes that the experience was bittersweet, as the author had to say goodbye to their infusion nurses who had been instrumental in their treatment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author had a suspicious mole removed from their body in early 2021, which turned out to be melanoma. The mole appeared suddenly and the author's doctor initially said it was fine. However, when the mole doubled in size and became darker, the author sought advice from a dermatology subreddit and was told it was normal. When the author finally saw a dermatologist, they were skeptical, but the mole was removed \"for peace of mind.\" The dermatologist later called the author and said that the mole was stage I melanoma. The author had a gut feeling that the mole was cancerous and nobody else seemed concerned, but they know that stage I melanoma is not that serious compared to other stages and other cancers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA 15-year-old boy with lung cancer shares that he is scared that his parents might shave his hair as a coping mechanism, but he doesn't want to cause his father to lose his hair again.

Now, the author is waiting for the results of a bone scan and is hoping for good news.

They have been doing chemotherapy every two weeks, but it is hard to endure. They are losing hair, weight, and muscle mass, and their legs are swelling. They have stomach pain that they try to manage with morphine. The doctor told them that the chances of survival are not good, and it is hard for their moral not knowing if they have any chance to survive and cope with the pain.

They hope that writing about their situation will help them feel better.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has received good news about their tumor shrinking from an MRI, and now they can undergo radiation and surgery.

They would rather retire and enjoy their life than go through more treatment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage IV melanoma since 2015.

They grew up in a difficult family environment with an alcoholic and drug-addictive mother and a father who did not care for them.

They will be taking a holiday next year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father has been diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 score of over 90%. He has been receiving radiotherapy for bone mets, but the main treatment is Keytruda immunotherapy.

The news was met with great joy, as the family had been hoping for a positive outcome. The radiologist also mentioned that the biggest and most worrying lesion had shrunk the most.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's wife passed away after 13 months of cancer treatments. She was just 36 years old. The author will miss her forever but cherishes the 11 and a half years they spent together.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's mother has stage IV ovarian cancer, and she has undergone several surgeries, chemo treatments, and a misplaced drain. Despite the difficult circumstances, the mother has remained optimistic and positive. However, after a recent hospitalization for colitis, the doctors have informed the family that there is nothing more that can be done. The author's mother is now on hospice care. The author is dealing with the loss of their grandmother and the anger that comes with it, but is seeking ways to accept the situation and move forward.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's mother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in August 2020, with a large empyema that required a tube in her right lung to drain. She later developed pneumonia and became weak, but was found to be a candidate for Tagrisso, a drug for EGFR-positive patients. In December, she started coughing blood and became tired, and her scans showed that her tumor had slowed down. However, when she went to the ER for a drop in hemoglobin, it was discovered that her tumor was causing a major bleed. Subsequent scans revealed that her lung cancer had eroded past her diaphragm and was pushing on her liver, causing internal bleeding. After multiple ER visits for transfusions, radiation was used to stop the bleeding, but it made her weak. She finished 10 rounds of radiation, but her hemoglobin kept dropping, and a CT scan revealed a separate kidney cancer. The tumor also caused bleeding that required a procedure to embolize or clog up the bleeding. She is currently in the ICU and on a do-not-resuscitate order. The author has anticipatory grief for the loss of her mother and is grateful for the time they spent together.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has stage IV Ulms, which is a type of cancer, and is feeling the effects of the disease, including fatigue and pain. They have informed their employer and will be going on disability. The author has spent 25 years working hard and achieving success in their career, but now they feel like a part of themselves has been taken away. They are worried about not being able to work and feel like they have already enjoyed their life because of their work. They feel that their family and friends do not understand the impact of the author's situation. The author is struggling to accept the idea that they will have to retire from work and is worried about the impact on their identity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma in December and has completed 5 rounds of chemotherapy. The oncologist called the author to schedule an appointment, and when the author went to the hospital, they were called into the oncologist's office. The oncologist told the author that the cancer has not responded to the chemo and that the author will need to undergo a stronger dosage of chemo for 7 more rounds and radiation 2-3 times a week. The author is an 18-year-old college student who is currently in online courses offered by the university they attended last year, and is considering transferring to a closer school but is unsure if they want to leave their dream school.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"summary_events = []\nfor txt in text:\n    response, history = model.chat(tokenizer,  f\"Summarize the events in the English narrative:'{txt}'\", history=[])\n    print(response)\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    summary_events.append(response)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-15T22:16:40.888858Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-15T22:16:40.889797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-15T22:22:54.663080Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-15T22:16:40.889758Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-15T22:22:54.662125Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The speaker has stage IV gallbladder cancer and had surgery in February. They have been receiving chemotherapy for 10 weeks and had a CT scan last Friday. The news is good, but they will still be receiving radiation treatment for 5 weeks. The speaker is feeling grateful for the news.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn November 17, 2021, the speaker lost their wife to stage IV lung cancer. She had just celebrated her 34th birthday and their second wedding anniversary. She was diagnosed with cancer on January 5, 2021, and went through various treatments including radiation, chemotherapy, and stents. Despite the complications, she remained optimistic and smiling. The speaker was her primary caregiver and rock, spending every day by her side. Now, they are left to navigate life without their wife and favorite food taster. They don't know how to move forward or how to sleep without her.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with stage IV cervical cancer in September, but recent CT scan shows no cancer. They have one final chemo infusion today and will get a pet scan in 3 weeks to be sure. If the pet scan is clean, they will receive avastin infusions every 3 weeks for a total of 12 infusions to prevent new cancers. The speaker is very happy and appreciative of the support they have received from others.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA person diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 16 undergoes two rounds of chemotherapy and a pet scan to show if the treatment plan is effective. The results show promising progress, with most of the tumors reduced by half. The person has two more rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy ahead, but is excited about the prospect of beating the disease and finally being in remission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in May 2019. He had extensive chemo and then liver surgery in November, and another round of chemo on Christmas Eve. The author and their family are now five months cancer-free and hope for a permanent cure. The author thanks the community for their support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author of the post was diagnosed with melanoma at age 21, and received responses from people who did not understand the seriousness of the disease. The author's cancer was later determined to be stage 2c melanoma. The author felt that the lack of effective treatments for advanced melanoma was a problem, and that immunotherapy was only available for later-stage melanoma. The author also mentioned that not all cancer is equal, and that going through harsh treatment does not mean the disease is any less serious. The author wanted to share their experiences and express their grievances.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's father was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer, and they moved back to the speaker's childhood home to help their mother and care for their father. The speaker spent 20 hours a week with their father in the hospital getting treatments and trying to maintain a positive attitude. They also met a new job and a girlfriend, and experienced a difficult time but also gained valuable lessons from it. The speaker reflects on the lessons they learned from their father's illness and how it changed their life, and they express gratitude to others for their support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA person who was diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer in October 2019, and has been through unsuccessful chemo and radiation, is now starting immunotherapy. They met with their doctor and were told that if the treatment doesn't work, they likely have less than six months to live. This has caused them to feel sad, scared, and angry, and they are unsure if it is worth continuing with the wedding plans. They are also worried about the process of dying and if they will be alone in a hospital bed. They are seeking advice on how to cope with this situation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with testicular cancer 24 days ago and had various tests, including bloodwork and imaging, to determine if it had spread. They underwent an orchiectomy two days after Christmas. This Thursday, they met with a surgeon/urologist who declared them cancer-free. The speaker is a survivor and has compassion and respect for others who had a longer and more difficult journey. They express gratitude to r/cancer for their support.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author has an update on their cancer story. After being diagnosed with stage IV melanoma, they received treatment with yervoy/opdivo and opdivo alone and were told it was gone. The author feels that the past nine months have been a bad dream and that they have been given a second chance to make their life better. They know that melanoma can be stubborn and may reoccur, but they are ready to fight again if necessary. The author encourages others who are still fighting cancer to stay strong.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is preparing for scans and a visit with their oncologist. They will be traveling to town for the scans and to see the oncologist. They mention enjoying delicious food from Del Taco and Xanex. They will have a CT and MRI scan, but then will enjoy a BBQ dinner with mac and cheese and banana pudding from a community q. The speaker is hoping that the scan results are good and that they will be able to go to a newly opened eatery called What-A-Burger for a meal. They mention that they have lost weight and will be dining like kings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker went to the emergency room with sudden severe abdominal pain, which was initially thought to be kidney stones. However, an ultrasound did not show any evidence of stones, but a X-ray did catch a mass in the lower left lung. The speaker had a biopsy on Christmas Eve and another three days later, which was stopped due to the need for deeper sedation. The results of the Pet scan were negative, but the pulmonologist found neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors with metaplastic bone formation. The speaker has a large spherical mass in the lower left lung and other growths in the airway that has spread to the lymph nodes. The speaker's doctors are holding a meeting to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The speaker is trying to take the situation in stride and enjoy the holiday season with their family. They are looking forward to a new year and hoping for all the best for everyone.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is excited to take a bath after a long time due to cancer treatment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author is a 28-year old survivor of kidney cancer. In October 2016, they went to the ER with stomach pain and was told by an ER doctor that they had a \"spot\" on their kidney, but it was no big deal and was sent to a urologist. The first urologist told the author that everything a textbook said would lean toward it not being harmful, but the author felt something was wrong and wanted answers. The second urologist walked in the room and didn't ask the author any questions and told the author that everything a textbook says would lean toward it not being harmful. The third urologist, the author's uncle, passed the information along to a colleague, who told the author that there was nothing to worry about, but the author decided to lean on this doctor going forward. At a three-month re-scan, the third urologist told the author and their family that more calcifications had appeared, but still seemed totally benign. The author trusted their instincts and their doctor, and decided to have the surgery. The author had clear cell renal cell carcinoma, stage 1, grade 2 and lost part of a kidney, but that is all. The author believes in science, but also believes in the self and that science can be wrong.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn 2011, the person was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and tumors had spread to their brain. They were given only a few months to live, and were treated with extreme chemo and radiation. Despite this, the person quit smoking and went to City of Hope Hospital for a second opinion, where the doctors were surprised by the radiation/chemo intensity and told the person that the other hospital would have made them a vegetable. The person had surgery to remove tumors from their brain and some radiation, and was given low-dose chemo and radiation for their lung tumors. They went into remission for 3 years, but had another mass on their lung in 2014, which required more radiation and chemo. Recently, they had a scan and found masses on their brain that resembled cauliflower, which required a biopsy, but turned out to be gone a month later. Despite the surgeries on the brain, the person is still alive and loses their balance sometimes and forgets things, but they are still here. The person is considered a walking miracle and a hero. The message of the narrative is to keep faith and fight against the monster, no matter what stage it is at.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage IIB vulvar cancer, which has spread to both bilateral lymph nodes. They have undergone surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment, and their pet/CT scan came back with no detectable cancer. Despite the challenges and ongoing risk, the speaker considers themselves \"won\" for now.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's father was diagnosed with stage 3c colorectal cancer in February 2018 and after 6 months of chemo and radiation, he beat cancer. However, in May 2019, the cancer came back in his liver, and he was diagnosed with stage IV cancer. He had 6 more months of chemo and an outstanding surgery, and was cancer-free in November 2019. The author had a recent scan and blood work, and the CEA level decreased to an all-time low of 0.5, although the author knows they are not out of the woods yet. The author is grateful for the support of the community and the doctors who helped their journey, including Dr. Remtulla and Dr. Geller.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's mother passed away after a battle with stage IV renal cancer. The speaker and their family were with their mother all night and witnessed her suffering. The speaker feels empty and lost and is sorry for the pain their mother endured. They express frustration and anger towards cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with inoperable stage IV cancer a year ago, but after multiple treatments including liver resection, radiation, chemo, and a rectal resection, is now cancer-free. They credit their family, friends, and girlfriend for support during the difficult time. They express hope for a cure for the disease and emphasize the importance of support for those facing the same diagnosis.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic urethelial cancer, which is 90% of bladder cancers and the sixth most common cancer in the US. They entered a trial using enfortumab vedotin combined with cisplatin, and by the second scan, all signs of cancer were gone. However, they are still receiving treatment and will reevaluate in March. The oncologist attributes the success to good health and a great support system. The speaker encourages others not to lose hope or pay attention to statistics.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has stage IV malignant melanoma, which was treated with opdivo and ipilimumab. A pet scan shows that the tumor and lesions are either gone or very close to gone. The speaker will continue monthly infusions of zometa to prevent bone weakening. In 3 months, another pet scan will be done and the oncologists will meet again. If there is no evidence of disease, the treatment schedule will be changed to a six-month schedule. The speaker is very relieved and grateful for the treatment they received at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe patient has been receiving treatment for 14 months, but the cancer is still spreading and they have been hospitalized twice for neutropenia. The oncologist and palliative doctor are supportive of no further treatment, and instead recommend seeking comfort measures. The patient is told they have months left and suggests using this time to fulfill any remaining wishes or items on their bucket list. They also express concern about how their family will cope when their pain ends, but overall maintains a positive outlook and does not fear death.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer, which is a rare type of cancer that only occurs in about 1% of cases. They are stage 1, which means the cancer is limited to one ovary, but they will need to have surgery to remove the affected ovary. The speaker is scared that the cancer will escalate and is feeling overwhelmed by the bad news. They have had to cancel their graduation, prom, and trip to Italy due to quarantine, and are unsure if they will be able to attend college this year. They are reaching out for support and good news.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage 1a endometrial adenocarcinoma, which is better than it could have been. They are relieved and grateful. They express their frustration with the idea that some people believe they are lucky to have cancer because it allows them to have children. The speaker says that they needed to have a rant about their experience. They express their anger towards cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker expresses sympathy for those who are experiencing the loss of a loved one to cancer, but also shares their own experience of having stage IV cancer and being in active treatment. They acknowledge that the long-term prognosis is not good, but for now, everything is okay. The speaker is taking a break from work, feeling well, and looking forward to spending time with their husband and child. The speaker also mentions that cancer can be a source of sadness, but that life can still be good.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer, but after a second biopsy and pet scan, it was confirmed that she is stage 1 non-metastasized. The oncologist said that it is the best case they could hope for, and with treatment, the chances of recovery are in the 90% range. Despite the positive news, the speaker has been stressed and overwhelmed by the thought of the worst case scenario. They are now focusing on the positive and hoping for a happy lifetime with their wife, who is currently undergoing treatment. The speaker is grateful for the love and support they have received from others.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn August 2017, the speaker's father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. He deteriorated rapidly and there were times when the speaker didn't think he would survive until the new year. Two years later, the speaker's father celebrated his 75th birthday and is now happy, healthy, and full of life. The doctors believe he may have beaten the stage IV lung cancer, and there has been no evidence of growth on any of his scans in over a year. The speaker's father has two more infusions and then they will take him off treatment and monitor for growth. The speaker thanks the doctors and physicians of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and everyone on a subreddit who provided comfort and advice in the early days. The speaker believes that no matter how bad the diagnosis, there is always hope, and it isn't false hope.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe events in the English narrative involve a person who was diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the stomach, with the prognosis being 6-10 months. They started on infusions, but had to switch to an oral regimen when his white cell count was too low. In February 2021, they found that there might be issues with the liver from taking the oxaliplatin, and tests showed a reactivated strain of parvo. He had been having stomach pain for a week, and was later admitted to the ER with a blockage in the liver. The doctors decided not to do a biliary stun but instead to do a drain, and the main goal was to make him comfortable. The cancer had metasticized to his liver, and it was in mid-stage liver failure due to a rare form of cancer that had rooted itself. He is at the end of his journey, and his pain is increasing, and it is likely that he will not make it past tomorrow night.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe person in the narrative has stage IV Ewing's sarcoma, which has not responded to chemotherapy, radiation, or medication. They have just returned from the Hope4Cure cancer treatment center in Mexico and seem to be in more pain since returning. They want to get their friend Jake CBD, cannabidiol, and other alternative drugs, but are now broke. They have started a chip-in and have received little help from their Facebook friends, so they are turning to Reddit for assistance. They will send a comic from their collection and keep people updated on Jake's condition. Jake is in the hospital and the doctors do not give him much time left. The person requests thoughts, prayers, and meditations. Jake passed away last night around 6 pm, and they are thinking of setting up a charity in his memory.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is a 16-year-old individual who has been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma, a type of cancer that affects the bone and soft tissues. They have undergone a full treatment plan, including high-dose chemotherapy, radiation, and a stem transplant. Despite the successful treatment, the cancer has come back and is now pressing on nerves in their back, causing pain and loss of sensation in their leg and genital areas. They have undergone treatment again, but are now aware that the cancer is not being cured and is being delayed. They express their frustration and sadness at the impact this has had on their life and their future plans.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker started a new job in June at a small company where everyone seemed team-oriented and they loved it. Their duties mainly involved office-related tasks such as answering phones and filing. However, a month into the job, they found out they had breast cancer, stage 1c, and had to take time off for surgery, recovery, and treatments. They explained their situation to HR and immediately wanted to know if they could be let go. HR told them that their position would still be there when they were recovered and even provided them with a monitor and desk phone to work from home.\n\nAfter the double mastectomy, the speaker tried to contact their supervisor, but no one responded to their emails or texts. They tried to get hold of HR again, and they were told that the company had decided to go in a different direction and that the speaker was done. The speaker was then sent a nasty email from HR asking for their equipment back, with a snippy response and no mention of the speaker's health situation or recent termination. The speaker felt that the company had prioritized their Avaya phone and dinky monitor over their health and well-being.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage 1b liposarcoma in their right bicep in March 2018, and the tumor was removed on March 15, 2018. Northwestern Medicine reviewed the pathology and CT, and the final treatment plan was no additional surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. The author is in remission and has an MRI and CT scheduled for September 1 to recheck their arm and keep an eye on the nodules in their lungs, but they are not worried at the moment. The author and their aunt spent the day walking and shopping, and had a glass of wine at Eataly before dinner. The author thanks everyone for their messages.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker posted about having stage 1 ovarian cancer and feeling burnt out, but now they are done with their 3 cycles of chemotherapy and ringing the bell, which is a symbol of victory. However, the moment is bittersweet as the speaker is sad to leave their infusion nurses.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker had a suspicious mole removed from their body in early 2021, which turned out to be melanoma. The mole appeared suddenly and the speaker's doctor initially said it was fine. However, when the mole doubled in size and became darker in color, the speaker sought advice from a dermatology subreddit and was told it was normal. When seen by a dermatologist, the speaker's mole was found to be relatively symmetrical and had even borders, so it was probably fine. But the speaker had a gut feeling that it was cancerous and when the dermatologist finally removed it, it was confirmed as stage I melanoma. The speaker knew that it wasn't their anxiety but still, nobody believed them.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author is a 15-year-old boy who was diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer two weeks ago and has started chemotherapy. He is scared that his parents may shave his hair as a way of dealing with the circumstances, but he doesn't want them to do that as it would deplete his father's chance of regrowing hair, which he loves. The author has already been diagnosed with cancer once before, at age 12, and had to go for checkups for two years. The cancer has now reduced in size by 20%, which is impressive, and the author is hopeful that he will be cancer-free with a half head of hair.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer at a young age, but has been doing well and has graduated from college and landed a job at a prestigious museum. Despite the challenges, the author has been able to maintain a positive attitude and wants to share their good news with the subreddit community that has supported them through their journey. The author's cancer marker levels have improved significantly, and they have three more rounds of chemo to go. The author is grateful for the support and community provided by the subreddit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker finished chemo for stage IV Ewing's Sarcoma, which spread to their pelvis, skull, spine, nerves, head, and lungs. They experienced various symptoms including groin pain, back pain, nerve pain, headaches, vision problems, and breathing problems. The chemo was effective, and after five months of scans, the results showed no growth. The speaker is waiting for the bone scan results and has been anxious since finishing chemo. They are hoping for good news but are also aware that cancer may recur. The speaker is feeling a sense of freedom now that the scans are good, but it's still a strange and difficult experience.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has stage IV colon cancer and has been alive for 5 years since their diagnosis. They express frustration with the experience but also relief and improvement in their current state. They express a desire to shout into the void that cancer can be difficult but sometimes it does not suck.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's friend has completed treatment for stage IV melanoma with spread to the lungs and liver. The friend tolerated the treatment, which means their body is no longer producing estrogen and their adrenal glands and thyroid are shot. Despite this, the speaker is hopeful that their energy levels will return over time. The speaker is grateful for the support of researchers, oncologists, nurses, friends, and family over the past two years. The speaker also invites others to reach out if they have any questions about immunotherapy for melanoma.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe English narrative is about a person who has been following the online advice and insights of a stranger named Roxy on Reddit. The person has an MRI coming up to determine if they have salivary gland cancer. Roxy's account began almost 9 years ago and covered topics such as jobs, camping, dogs, quitting smoking, and her struggles with chronic anxiety. She was also a parent to a young child and had plans for further children in the future. Roxy mentioned that she had been dealing with cancer for nearly 7 years, and while her doctors had eliminated the parotid tumors through radiation and surgery, there were concerning masses in her lungs. She was afraid but \"ready to fight\". Roxy also mentioned that there is no known standard of care that promises to decrease the chances of metastasis of this cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker (34-year-old France guy) experienced some health issues at work and was later diagnosed with stomach cancer. He undergoes chemotherapy every two weeks, but it's hard for him to endure the side effects such as hair loss, weight loss, muscle loss, and stomach pain. The speaker is unsure of his stage and whether he has a chance to survive. He used to be social but now prefers to stay alone and doesn't want others to pity him. Writing about his situation has made him feel a bit better.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has received good news about their tumor shrinking from an MRI, and is hopeful that radiation and surgery will be an option. They are also waiting for their latest CT scan and are keeping their fingers crossed for good news. Despite the cancer, the speaker is amazed at the progress in medical treatment and the number of people they have met who have had cancer and are now healthy. They are sending positive vibes to others and have a newfound wealth, but are unsure of how to use it. They offer to be contacted by someone named Gilder.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic rectal cancer with mets in the liver and scapula three years ago. They underwent chemotherapy, radiation, an ostomy, lower anterior resection, an ostomy reversal, and a radical scapulectomy. Despite the difficult treatment, they are now cancer-free. The speaker's experience provides hope for others and they wish the best of luck to others undergoing treatments.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker is reflecting on their experience with stage IV prostate cancer and the lessons they've learned about fatal diagnoses. They find that many people around them go through stages of grief when someone they love is diagnosed with an incurable illness, but that not everyone handles it the same way. The speaker's friends and family give unsolicited advice, such as to be cautious and eat certain foods, which the speaker finds unhelpful. They also find that people tend to avoid discussing the topic of cancer and that it can be difficult to find support. Despite all of this, the speaker is determined to make the most of the time they have left and is considering buying a motorcycle, running a bar, or owning a basketball team as a way to live life to the fullest.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage IV melanoma since 2015. In 2007, there was no such thing as remission for a late stage melanoma patient. Despite this, the speaker's oncologist believes that the targeted therapy is necessary to suppress any cancer cells. However, the news of the diagnosis was still considered amazing because it was a possible improvement in treatment options.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer and is losing weight rapidly, with a likely timeline of weeks or months. They grew up in a difficult environment with a drug-addict/alcoholic mother and a father who didn't care about them. They have had a string of abusive and borderline-personality-disordered relationships throughout their life and have never been married or had children. They are feeling angry and isolated, and have questions about God and the universe for causing them a difficult life.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's father has been diagnosed with stage IV melanoma, but the immunotherapy he has been receiving has been effective in keeping the cancer at bay. Recent scans and blood results have shown no change, which is positive news. The speaker's father is considering booking a holiday for next year. The speaker is happy for their father and hopes that others are also receiving good news from their results. They apologize if they have offended anyone by posting about their father's condition.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's father has been diagnosed with NSCLC stage IV PD-L1 cancer, which has a high percentage of PD-L1 expression. He has been receiving radiotherapy for bone mets, but the main therapy is keytruda immunotherapy. The speaker describes a significant improvement in the lung lesions compared to the last scan, with 40-50% reduction in size. The radiologist also mentioned that the largest and most worrying lesion has shrunk the most. This positive news brings hope to the speaker's family after a difficult time.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's wife has passed away after a long battle with stage IV metastatic breast cancer, which lasted 13 months and involved chemo, immunotherapy, and radiation treatments. She was just 36 years old. The speaker will miss her forever but will always cherish the 11 and a half years they spent together.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker's mother has been diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, stage IV, and has undergone three surgeries, as well as multiple rounds of chemotherapy. Despite this, she remains optimistic and has had a strong spirit throughout her illness. However, she has now been hospitalized with a large stomach tumor that is causing a total bowel blockage, and the doctors have informed her that there is nothing more to be done. She is now on hospice care. The speaker is their child and is struggling to come to terms with the fact that their mother is dying. They are angry and upset, but also have a deep love and respect for their mother and the life she has led.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe author's mother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in August 2020 with a large empyema that required a tube in her right lung to drain. She improved in September and was considered a candidate for Tagrisso, a drug for EGFR-positive patients. In December, she started coughing up blood and became weak. Scans showed her tumor had slowed down, but during an ER visit for low hemoglobin, it was discovered that the tumor was causing a major bleed. In March 2021, after multiple ER visits for transfusions, the doctors radiated the tumor to stop the bleeding, but it made her even weaker.\n\nRecent scans showed that her tumor had eroded past her diaphragm and was pushing on her liver, causing internal bleeding. A procedure to embolize or clog up the bleeding was done, but it caused her oxygen levels to drop drastically. She is now in the ICU and on a do-not-resuscitate order.\n\nThe author has had anticipatory grief for six months and is grateful for her mother's role in raising her and her sisters. She believes she will be lost without her, and the thought is extremely scary. The author's mother passed away with no hospice. The author will try to live on with her mother's morals and values.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker has stage IV ulms and is on disability due to the advanced nature of the disease.

They have a history of dropping out of college and eventually found a career that suited them well. They took pride in their work and were highly successful, creating systems, processes, policies, and instructions for their employer. Now, they feel like a large part of themselves has been taken away and are struggling to come to terms with the idea of retirement. They feel like their family and friends do not understand the impact of the situation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe speaker was diagnosed with stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma in December and has completed 5 rounds of chemotherapy.

Hi reddit family!\n2. I've posted quite a bit in here about my dad's journey.\n3. He's a 50 year old man diagnosed with stage 3c colorectal cancer in February 2018.\n4. After 6 months of chemo and radiation, he beat cancer.\n5. For a few months, that is.\n6. May 2019 it came back in his liver, boosting us up to stage iv.\n7. I was devastated.\n8. But after 6 more months of chemo, an outstanding surgery, and a bit more chemo, he was cancer fucking free in November 2019.\n9. Flash forward to now, he had his first scan and blood work.\n10. I was so terrified.\n11. But his CEA level decreased even more to an all time low of 0.5!!\n12. I know we aren't out of the woods yet, but this small victory is enough to make me jump out of my seat and dance a jig.\n13. Thank you so much to this amazing community for all the support.\n14. I hope this story can serve as inspiration to everyone.\n15. Also quick plug for the amazing doctors that helped us on this journey.\n16. We are in Pittsburgh and see Dr. Remtulla as our oncologist and our liver surgeon was Dr. Geller.\n17. These doctors played such a huge role in our journey and I owe them a million thank yous.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-my mom just passed this morning after battling stage iv renal cancer\n-we were with her all night\n-she was in a lot of pain\n-watching the death rattle was difficult\n-when we finally all dozed off at day break\n-she passed peacefully\n-i feel so empty and lost\n-i’m so sorry for all the pain she had to endure over the last six months\n-fuck cancer\n-fuck it straight to hell\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. I don't even know where to begin.\n2. A year ago to this day I heard the words every 20 something year old and his family should never have to hear, \"you have stage iv cancer, and it is inoperable.\"\n3. To hear these words spoken about oneself can't be described. I was numb, scared, shattered, and at the same time I had no idea what the hell was going on.\n4. To put a long story short, after two liver resections to remove five liver tumors, (one of which was in a tricky spot) 32 radiation treatments, chemo treatments, and a rectal resection, my latest ct scan shows that I am cancer free.\n5. I couldn't have done it without my family, friends, and girlfriend who stayed overnight on the couch in my hospital room for weeks on end.\n6. I just wish everyone who has been given the same original diagnosis could be blessed with the same uplifting news I received this morning.\n7. What scares me more than having to get updated scans to check if the disease came back is the fact that it is certain I will have people close to me, my age, who will have to endure the endless amounts of needles, tests, scans, and all that fun stuff that comes along with a diagnosis of this terrible disease.\n8. We need a cure, and we need it fast.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is a list of events in the order they occurred in the text:\n\n1.

'20, pet scan showed it was cancer, plus lesions on liver, in abdomen, in femur, and in a vertebra. ipilimumab was added to the immunotherapy treatment in jan.; six weeks ago taken off immunotherapy bc of prednizone prescribed for colitis, but also doctors could no longer feel the lump on my back they were using as a sentinel. because of that plus the colitis and iritis, they felt my immune system was now cranked up and attacking the cancer, so they set a follow-up pet scan after i finished the steroids (which was today's scan)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* The patient has been receiving treatment for 14 months, but the chemo options (folfoxiri, folfox, 5fu, folfiri) are no longer working and the cancer is spreading.\n* The patient's organs are not doing well and they have been hospitalized twice for neutropenia.\n* The oncologist and palliative doctor are supporting no further treatment and seeking comfort measures.\n* The patient has been told they have months left and to do their last wishes or bucket list items as soon as possible and get their affairs in order.\n* The patient is curious about how things will play out for them, but is positive and doesn't fear death.\n* The patient is worried about the pain of their family members when their pain ends.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

It's just...I don't want my last thought to be \"gosh I wish I had spent time with my loved ones instead of work.\" So it's time.\n4. I took a long time to get through college - dropped out a few times before finally getting serious on a career that surprised me like a glove. I wasn't just good - I was really good. Prided myself on being the \"superstar\" (great shades of Molly Shannon, I know). I did a lot for my employers - got them on solid systems and processes. Created policies, wikis, how-to videos, and step by step diagrams for everything I was or had been doing. They're in a good place as long as they keep up with my instructions.\n5. It's just...I feel like I plowed onto a center meridian at 150 mph. The last 25 years have been all about shining and taking pride in the work I do and results I've achieved.

I keep picking up my phone to check emails, only to realize that isn't my job any more. I don't think my family or friends understand. They see it as \"woo hoo, time to enjoy life and party now that work is done\" but I'm like \"I already enjoyed my life a lot **because** I had work to do.\"\n7. Thanks to cancer, I've had pieces of me sliced out bits at a time, but none of them felt as devastating as my job-ectomy.\n8. Sorry, I just needed a place to say this because I don't think the family would understand if I told them how hard this is - I can accept my own death more readily than the death of my career. It's like it wasn't enough for cancer to take various pieces of my body - it had to take the thing I loved too.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-diagnosis with stage ii hodgkin's lymphoma\n-completed 5 rounds of chemotherapy\n-received a call from oncologist with news of cancer not being gone\n- placed on stronger dosage of chemo for 7 more rounds\n-to undergo radiation 2-3 times a week\n-finished freshman year of college\n-contemplating transferring to a school closer to home\n- uncertain about leaving dream school\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cancer_specific_aspects = []\nfor txt in text:\n    response, history = model.chat(tokenizer,  f\"Extract the cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative:'{txt}'\", history=[])\n    print(response)\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    cancer_specific_aspects.append(response)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-15T22:48:42.377834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-15T22:48:42.378788Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-15T22:57:11.643991Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-15T22:48:42.378759Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-15T22:57:11.643013Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n* The individual has stage IV gallbladder cancer.\n* They have undergone surgery for the cancer.\n* They have undergone 10 weeks of chemotherapy.\n* They had a CT scan last Friday.\n* They will undergo radiation treatment for 5 weeks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n* The person lost their wife to stage IV lung cancer.\n* The wife was diagnosed with cancer on 1/5/2021.\n* The primary tumors in the middle of her chest made the cancer inoperable.\n* Radiation and chemotherapy failed.\n* She had complications such as stents, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and fluid drains.\n* Despite the challenges, the person's wife smiled and they laughed and joked together.\n* The person was her primary caregiver and rock.\n* Cancer stole her from the person.\n* The person is struggling to adjust to life without their wife.\n* They have been writing about their feelings and struggles with cancer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n* Diagnosis: stage iv cervical cancer\n* Tumor assessment: no cancer shown on the CT scan from last week\n* Treatment plan: final chemo infusion, followed by pet scan in 3 weeks for confirmation, and potential avastin infusions every 3 weeks for a total of 12 infusions\n* Emotional response: over the moon, excited, thankful for support, well wishes, and blessings\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n* The person is 16 years old and has been diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n* The person has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy.\n* The person is having another pet scan to see if their treatment plan is effective.\n* The results of the pet scan show promising progress, with most of the person's tumors reduced by half.\n* The person still has two more rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy ahead of them.\n* The person is excited about the progress but still has a ways to go.\n* The person cannot wait to beat the cancer and finally be in remission.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n* The diagnosis of the patient's father with stage IV colorectal cancer in May 2019\n* The patient's father had extensive chemo treatment\n* The patient's father had liver surgery in November 2019\n* The patient's father had more chemo treatment (the last one on Christmas Eve)\n* The patient's father is now 5 months completely cancer-free\n* The patient's father is hoping for a cure\n* The diagnosis of stage IV cancer is described as heartbreaking\n* The patient and their family are幸运 enough to have gotten through this journey\n* The patient is grateful for the continued support of the community.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cancer-specific aspects in the English narrative are:\n\n1.
